## Task 1: software configuration

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

It was a bit challenging to me to start something completely different
from that things which I've done before and had strong experience with.
But I glad to find this challenge and use it as a part of my new journey. 
Thank you a lot, for this opportunity.
